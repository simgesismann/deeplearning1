Create basic model
## There is linear basic formula to convert celcius to fahrenheit
## multiply by 1.8 (or 9/5) and add 32
## F= C*1.8+32
## I WANT TO ACHIEVE CREATE MODEL WITHOUT USING THAT FORMULA
# Sequential model is appropriate for a plain stack of layers where each layer has exactly one input tensor and one output tensor.
#ASK USER FOR CELCIUS TO CONVERT FAHRENHEIT:
##LETS COMPARE THE VALUEs whÄ±ch are calculated and predicted
#lets check weights bias
#model gives that bias is 31.58 and w1 is 1.80 , that is almost correct and model is created succesfully
